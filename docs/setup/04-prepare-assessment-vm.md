# Prepare the Assessment VM

## Purpose

This page is the quick gateway into the later Ubuntu VM assessment path.

Use it only when your instructor asks you to prepare the VM-based deployment path.

You do not need this page for the early browser-first labs.

## When To Use This

Use this page:

- before `LAB-07`
- before `EX-11`
- when you are preparing one Ubuntu VM for the final Docker-based deployment path

Do not use this page:

- before Day 1
- before `LAB-01`, `LAB-02`, `LAB-03`, or `LAB-04`
- for the early browser-first course flow

## Script To Use

The script lives here:

`scripts/install-assessment-deps.sh`

This page gives you the first commands and the timing for that script.

If you want the fuller VM checklist and deeper reference notes, use:

- [Prepare the Ubuntu VM](../assessment/02-prepare-ubuntu-vm.md)

It prepares or checks the common tools needed for the assessment VM:

- Git
- SSH client tools
- Docker
- `curl`
- `jq`
- basic network troubleshooting tools

It also checks:

- Docker daemon status
- Docker group access
- whether port `8000` is already in use

## VM Commands

From your repository on your own machine, copy the script to the VM:

```bash
scp scripts/install-assessment-deps.sh <vm-user>@<vm-host>:~/
```

Connect to the VM:

```bash
ssh <vm-user>@<vm-host>
```

Run the script with `sudo`:

```bash
chmod +x ~/install-assessment-deps.sh
sudo ~/install-assessment-deps.sh --target-user <vm-user>
```

## Check-Only Mode

If you want to validate the machine again later without reinstalling packages:

```bash
bash ~/install-assessment-deps.sh --check-only --target-user <vm-user>
```

`--check-only` means:

- no packages are installed
- no Docker group changes are made
- no firewall rules are changed
- the script only reports what is ready and what still needs attention

## Optional Firewall Flag

By default, the script does not change firewall rules.

If you explicitly want it to add `ufw` rules for ports `22` and `8000`, use:

```bash
sudo ~/install-assessment-deps.sh --target-user <vm-user> --configure-firewall
```

Use that flag only if:

- your VM uses `ufw`
- you understand that you are changing local firewall rules on the VM

If you are unsure, skip that flag and keep the default safe behavior.

## What Success Looks Like

At the end of the script, the important checks should show `PASS`:

- Ubuntu release
- Git
- SSH client
- Docker CLI
- Docker daemon

This result may show `WARN` the first time:

- Docker user access

That usually means the user was just added to the Docker group.

If you want the fuller meaning of each check, use:

- [Prepare the Ubuntu VM](../assessment/02-prepare-ubuntu-vm.md)

## Common Warnings

`Docker user access = WARN`

- The target user was added to the Docker group.
- Sign out and sign back in once, then rerun `--check-only` if you want to confirm it.

`Firewall rules = WARN`

- The script did not confirm that ports `22` and `8000` are both allowed locally.
- This script does not manage cloud firewall, NSG, or security-group rules.

`Port 8000 = WARN`

- Something is already using port `8000`.
- Stop the old process or choose the correct VM before the assessment.

`Docker Compose plugin = WARN`

- That plugin is optional for this course.
- The current assessment path does not require it.

## Important Reminder About Network Access

Even if the script passes, your VM may still need external network rules that allow:

- SSH on port `22`
- app access on port `8000`

That part is outside the VM itself.

If your VM lives behind cloud networking rules, security groups, or NSGs, you must still allow those ports there.
