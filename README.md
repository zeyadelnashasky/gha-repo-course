# GitHub Actions CI/CD Course for Beginners

## What This Repository Is For

This is the student repository for a 2-day beginner-friendly CI/CD course.

We will follow one simple story through the whole course:

1. code
2. verify
3. package
4. deliver

## Start Here

Use these four entry points to navigate the repository:

1. [Student Setup Guide](docs/setup/README.md)
2. [Labs Guide](labs/README.md)
3. [Exercises Index](exercises/README.md)
4. [Help Guide](docs/help/README.md)

## How to Use This Repository During Class

- Open the section for the part of the course we are in now.
- Early labs are browser-first. You do not need local Git to start.
- Change one thing at a time, especially in YAML files.
- If a workflow fails, read the logs before changing more files.

## Core versus Optional

During the main course, focus on Labs `01` to `05`.

For the core path, focus on these workflows:

- `01 Hello Workflow`
- `02 CI Workflow`
- `03 Build Artifact Workflow`
- `04 Deploy Workflow`

At the start of the course, focus on the four core workflows first.

Use this simple rule:

- core beginner path = workflows `01` to `04` and Labs `01` to `05`
- `LAB-05` is still part of the guided Day 2 continuation
- `LAB-05` does not correspond to workflow `05`
- later guided extension = `LAB-07` and `EX-11` when your instructor starts the Ubuntu VM assessment path
- optional examples = workflow examples `05`, `06`, `LAB-06`, and the cloud-oriented extra reading
- most exercises modify the workflow file from the lab you just finished
- `EX-11` is the later exception where you create workflow `08`

Use this quick rule in the `Actions` tab:

- main path = the lab or exercise page your instructor is teaching now
- core workflows = `01`, `02`, `03`, `04`
- most exercises = keep modifying the lab workflow file you already know
- final assessment prep workflow = `07`
- final assessment workflow = create `08` yourself later when the final assessment page asks you to
- optional next-step examples = workflows `05`, `06`, and later example pages

Workflow `08` will not appear in the `Actions` tab until you create `.github/workflows/08-final-deployment-assessment.yml` during `EX-11`.

## Day 1

Day 1 is about one question:

How do we know a change is still safe?

Open these files during Day 1:

1. [Course Story with Diagrams](docs/course-story/README.md)
2. [Course Map](docs/00-course-map.md)
3. [Engineering Problems, CI/CD, and Branching Strategy](docs/09-engineering-problems-cicd-and-branching.md)

12. [Exercises Index](exercises/README.md)
13. [Labs Guide](labs/README.md)

Exercises always follow the related lab.

Use these supporting pages only when you need them:

1. [Course Map](docs/00-course-map.md)
2. [Our Tiny Example App](docs/01-our-tiny-example-app.md)
3. [Runner Mental Model](docs/help/00-runner-mental-model.md)

5. [YAML Cheatsheet for GitHub Actions](docs/help/04-yaml-cheatsheet.md)
6. [Finding and Reusing GitHub Actions](docs/help/07-finding-and-reusing-actions.md)

## Day 2

Day 2 is about one question:

What do we deliver after the code is verified?

Open these files during Day 2:

1. [Day 2 Opening Bridge](docs/day-2-opening-bridge.md)
2. [Artifacts, Images, and Containers](docs/02-artifacts-images-and-containers.md)
3. [Lab 03: Build Artifact Workflow](labs/LAB-03-build-artifact-workflow.md)
4. [Exercise 05: Build Artifact with Buildx](exercises/EX-05-build-artifact-with-buildx.md)
5. [Exercise 06: CI Then Build Artifact With `needs`](exercises/EX-06-ci-then-build-artifact-with-needs.md)
6. [Simulated Deployment](docs/03-simulated-deployment.md)
7. [Lab 04: Deploy Workflow](labs/LAB-04-deploy-workflow.md)
8. [Exercise 07: Deploy and Inspect the Deployment](exercises/EX-07-deploy-inspect-the-deployment.md)
9. [Lab 05: Full CI/CD Flow](labs/LAB-05-full-cicd-flow.md)
10. [Exercise 09: Full Flow Failure and Recovery](exercises/EX-09-full-flow-failure-and-recovery.md)
11. [Exercise 10: PR-Based CI/CD with Branch Protection](exercises/EX-10-pr-based-ci-cd-with-branch-protection.md)
12. [Final Recap](docs/04-final-recap.md)
13. [Labs Guide](labs/README.md)

`EX-05` and `EX-06` both extend `.github/workflows/03-build-artifact.yml`.

Do `EX-05` first, then use `EX-06` to strengthen that same build workflow with a clearer multi-job shape.

`LAB-05` is the integration lab that reuses workflows `02`, `03`, and `04`.

## Final Assessment

After the main Day 2 path and the related exercises, your instructor may give you one final assessed exercise.

It keeps the same story and asks you to build one fuller deployment workflow yourself:

- build a Docker image
- push it to Docker Hub
- deploy that same image to an Ubuntu VM over SSH

Open these files in order:

1. [Final Assessment Support Overview](docs/assessment/README.md)
2. [Standardized Assessment Setup](docs/assessment/01-standardized-assessment-setup.md)
3. [Prepare the Assessment VM](docs/setup/04-prepare-assessment-vm.md)
4. [Prepare the Ubuntu VM](docs/assessment/02-prepare-ubuntu-vm.md)
5. [Configure Docker Hub, SSH, and GitHub Secrets](docs/assessment/03-configure-secrets-and-ssh.md)
6. [How the Current Labs Prepare You](docs/assessment/04-how-current-labs-prepare-you.md)
7. [LAB-07: Final Assessment Setup and Validation Prep](labs/LAB-07-docker-hub-vm-deploy.md)
8. [EX-11: Final Deployment Assessment](exercises/EX-11-final-deployment-assessment.md)
9. [Assessment Success Criteria and Rubric](docs/assessment/05-success-criteria-and-rubric.md)

`LAB-07` uses one preloaded readiness workflow to check the setup.

`EX-11` is the build-it-yourself part.

You create the final assessment workflow file yourself, and the prepared solution lives only in the instructor repo.

Workflow `08` will not appear in the `Actions` tab until you create `.github/workflows/08-final-deployment-assessment.yml` during `EX-11`.

## Assessment Prep

Use this only when your instructor asks you to prepare the Ubuntu VM assessment path.

The early course flow stays browser-first.

You do not need the assessment VM setup script before Day 1 or the early labs.

When the assessment path starts, use:

- [Prepare the Assessment VM](docs/setup/04-prepare-assessment-vm.md)
- `scripts/install-assessment-deps.sh`

## One Reminder

You do not need to memorize GitHub Actions syntax.

Keep returning to the main story:

1. code
2. verify
3. package
4. deliver
